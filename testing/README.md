# Testing the gocrawler locally
The idea is to have the gocrawler be testable from end-to-end but not 
have to go out to the internet for data. This folder will allow us to
setup an http server that will serve pre-canned web pages that the 
crawler will crawl. This will allow integration/system testing in a more
well-defined manner.
